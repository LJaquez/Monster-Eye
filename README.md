# Monster Eye Animation
## Project Description: 

For this porject we were given some starter code with JS, HTML and CSS that needed to be adapted so that two eyes would follow the cursor. After having completing the project, I adapted the project to express my creativity. I made my own monster character vector on Inkscape. Found how to attach it to the background of the page, and make it adjust to the window size. Then I reverted the code to one eye and moved the eye to be in proper placement relative to the monster vector. 

## What does the current project do? 
Monster's Eye moves in direction and in scale to mouse placement.

## How to Run: 
*Clone the repository
*Run the eye.html file
*Move your mouse around the window

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
*Have monster blink upon mouse-click
*Have monster grunt upon pressing certain keys
